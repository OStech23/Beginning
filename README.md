<h2>                 Welcome to OStech</h2>

<p>     This is the beginning of a new dawn. Actually I love computers alot and I decide to learn coding. And i'm doing that with the help of <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank"> freecodecamp</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.com" target="_blank">coursera</a> and <a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank">github</a>.</p> </main>

<p> At first it was quite confusing, but I'm beginning to get a little grasp of everything and it's quite amazing.</p>
<p>I love lots of stuff some of these includes;

<ul>
<li>Gaming</li>
<li>Coding</li> 
<li>Sleeping</li>
<li>making money</li> </ul>etc </p>

<p> Just as much as i love these things there are acouple of things that i hate also and some of them are;
<ol>
<li>Being broke</li>
<li>Having no data</li>
<li>Family problems/issues I can't solve atm</li>
<li>Having no phone</li>
<li>Laying around with nothing to do (no direction in life atm)</li> 
</ol> etc
I can go on and on and on. But let's stop there for now</p>
<p>
You can let me know what you hate/love below;
<form action="https://ostech23.github.io/Beginning/"> <input type="text" placeholder="What do you hate/love" required> <button type="submit">Submit</button> </form> </p>

<p>
I also want to know what you'd prefer between Self employed or being an employee in a company;
<form action="https://ostech23.github.io/Beginning/">
<label for="self-employed">
<input id="self-employed" type="radio" name="self-employed-employee">Self-employed </label>
<label for="employee">
<input id="employee" type="radio" name="self-employed-employee">Employee </label> <button type="submit">Submit</button>



<p> Want to use this opportunity to say a big thank you to my family for all the love and support. I'm super grateful. I love y'all forever.
