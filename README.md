<p> At first it was quite confusing, but I'm beginning to get a little grasp of everything and it's quite amazing.</p>
<p> I love lots of stuff some of these includes;
<div>
<ul>
<li>Gaming</li>
<li>Coding</li> 
<li>Sleeping</li>
<li>making money</li> </ul>etc

<p> Just as much as i love these things there are acouple of things that i hate also and some of them are;
<ol>
<li>Being broke</li>
<li>Having no data</li>
<li>Family problems/issues I can't solve atm</li>
<li>Having no phone</li>
<li>Laying around with nothing to do (no direction in life atm)</li> 
</ol> etc
I can go on and on and on. But let's stop there for now</p>
<p>
You can let me know what you hate/love below;
<form action="https://ostech23.github.io/Beginning/"> <input type="text" placeholder="What do you hate/love" required> <button type="submit">Submit</button> </form> </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
I also want to know what you'd prefer between Self employed or being an employee in a company;
<form action="https://ostech23.github.io/Beginning/">
<label for="self-employed">
<input id="self-employed" value="self-employed" type="radio" name="self-employed-employee" check>Self-employed </label>
<label for="employee">
<input id="employee" value="employee" type="radio" name="self-employed-employee" check>Employee </label> <button type="submit">Submit</button> </form> </p>
<p> I'd also love to know your personality, to do this, i'd need you to tick any of the following personality categories that you fall into as a person.
<form action="https://ostech23.github.io/Beginning/">
<label for="loving">
<input type="checkbox" value="loving" id="loving" name="personality" check> Loving </label>
<label for="caring">
<input type="checkbox" id="caring" value="caring" name="personality" check> Caring </label>
<label for="sassy">
<input type="checkbox" value="sassy" id="sassy" name="personality" check> Sassy </label>
<label for="humble">
<input type="checkbox" id="humble" value="humble" name="personality" check> Humble </label>
<label for="ambitious">
<input type="checkbox" value="ambitious" id="ambitious" name="personality" check> Ambitious </label>
<label for="courageous">
<input type="checkbox" value="courageous" id="courageous" name="personality" check> Courageous </label>
<label for="honest">
<input type="checkbox" value="honest" id="honest" name="personality" check> Honest </label> <button type="submit">Submit</button> </form> </p>
<p> Well, there are so many people in the world with different personalities, I obviously cannot state them all here. So if you do not fall into any of these categories or you feel there are more you need to describe the kind of person you are, please specify in the box below;
<form action="https://ostech23.github.io/Beginning/"><input type="text" placeholder="Type Here"> <button type="submit">Submit</button> </form>
</p>
</div>
<p> Want to use this opportunity to say a big thank you to my family for all the love and support. I'm super grateful. I love y'all forever. </p>
